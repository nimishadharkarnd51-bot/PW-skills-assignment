        "#14 Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "Answer - Polymorphism is very important in OOP because it makes programs flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "It allows one interface (one method name) to work in different ways depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why polymorphism matters:\n",
        "1. It Allows the Same Code to Work for Different Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "You can write one function or method and use it for many different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "for animal in [Dog(), Cat(), Cow()]:\n",
        "    animal.sound()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Each object responds differently using its own sound() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "⭐ 2. It Supports Extensibility (Easy to Add New Classes)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can add new classes later without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Add a new class Lion → existing loops or functions still work.\n",
        "\n",
        "⭐ 3. It Makes Code More Flexible\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows dynamic behavior based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why:\n",
        "\n",
        "same method name\n",
        "\n",
        "same interface\n",
        "\n",
        "different behaviors\n",
        "…becomes possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "⭐ 4. It Helps Implement Method Overriding\n",
        "\n",
        "Overriding enables child classes to change parent class behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is essential for:\n",
        "\n",
        "custom behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "specialized classes\n",
        "\n",
        "real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "⭐ 5. Cleaner, More Organized Code\n",
        "\n",
        "Without polymorphism, you would need many if-else conditions:\n",
        "\n",
        "if type == \"Dog\":\n",
        "    bark()\n",
        "elif type == \"Cat\":\n",
        "    meow()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With polymorphism, the method call is automatic.\n",
        "\n",
        "⭐ 6. Valuable for Real-World OOP Design\n",
        "\n",
        "Many design patterns (like Strategy, Factory, Template Method) depend on polymorphism."

        "Answer - Here are the main advantages of OOP explained simply:\n",
        "\n",
        "🌟 1. Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows you to reuse existing code through inheritance.\n",
        "Instead of writing the same code again, child classes can reuse parent class features.\n",
        "\n",
        "✔ Saves time\n",
        "✔ Reduces code duplication\n",
        "\n",
        "🌟 2. Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP breaks a program into small, independent modules (classes).\n",
        "\n",
        "✔ Easy to understand\n",
        "✔ Easy to organize\n",
        "✔ Easy to modify without affecting other parts\n",
        "\n",
        "🌟 3. Encapsulation (Data Protection)\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP keeps data safe and hidden inside classes.\n",
        "Only controlled access is allowed through getters/setters or @property.\n",
        "\n",
        "✔ Prevents accidental data modification\n",
        "✔ Protects sensitive information\n",
        "\n",
        "🌟 4. Abstraction (Hides Complexity)\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP lets you hide unnecessary details and show only important features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "You call .start() on a car object without knowing how the engine works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "✔ Reduces complexity\n",
        "✔ Makes code cleaner and easier to use\n",

        "\n",
