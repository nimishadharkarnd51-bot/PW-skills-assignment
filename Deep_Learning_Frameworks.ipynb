        "ensorFlow 2.0 differs from TensorFlow 1.x mainly in terms of usability, execution style, and simplicity. TensorFlow 1.x follows a static computation graph approach, where the graph must be defined first and then executed using sessions, placeholders, and feed dictionaries, making the code complex and harder to debug. In contrast, TensorFlow 2.0 uses eager execution by default, which allows operations to run immediately like normal Python code, making debugging and experimentation much easier. TensorFlow 2.0 also integrates Keras as its primary high-level API, simplifying model building, training, and evaluation with functions like model.fit() and model.predict(). Additionally, TensorFlow 2.0 removes redundant APIs, improves readability, supports automatic differentiation through GradientTape, and provides better tools for production deployment. Overall, TensorFlow 2.0 is more intuitive, developer-friendly, and efficient compared to TensorFlow 1.x."
