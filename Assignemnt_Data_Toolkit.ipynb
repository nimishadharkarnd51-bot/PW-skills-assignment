        "Answer - NumPy arrays and Python lists differ in several important ways. A NumPy array stores data in a continuous block of memory, making it much faster and more efficient for numerical operations, while a Python list stores elements in separate memory locations, which slows down computation. NumPy arrays require all elements to have the same data type, whereas Python lists can hold mixed data types. NumPy also supports vectorized operations, meaning mathematical calculations can be performed on entire arrays without using loops, but Python lists require explicit iteration for such tasks. Because of these features, NumPy arrays use less memory and offer advanced mathematical functions, making them ideal for scientific and data-heavy applications, whereas Python lists are more general-purpose and flexible but less suitable for large-scale numerical computing."

        "Answer - A heatmap is a data visualization technique that uses colors to represent values in a matrix or table. It helps show patterns, correlations, and intensity levels in the data at a glance by using darker or lighter shades to indicate higher or lower values. Heatmaps are especially useful when analyzing large datasets, comparing many variables, or visualizing correlation matrices in statistics and machine learning. They are commonly used to identify trends, highlight strong relationships between variables, or detect patterns that may not be obvious from raw numerical data."

        "#8 What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy\n",
        "Answer - In NumPy, a vectorized operation refers to performing mathematical operations on entire arrays at once, without using explicit Python loops. Instead of processing elements one by one, NumPy applies the operation simultaneously to all elements using highly optimized C-based implementations. This makes computations much faster, more efficient, and more readable. For example, adding two NumPy arrays performs element-wise addition automatically, which is an example of vectorized computation. Vectorized operations are one of the main reasons NumPy is preferred for scientific and numerical computing."

        "Answer - NumPy handles multidimensional arrays using a powerful data structure called the ndarray (N-Dimensional Array). It is designed to efficiently store and operate on data in any number of dimensions—2D, 3D, 4D, or more.\n",

        "How NumPy Handles Multidimensional Arrays\n",

        "\n",
        "1D arrays → vectors\n",
        "\n",
        "2D arrays → matrices\n",
        "\n",
        "3D arrays → tensors\n",
        "\n",
        "nD arrays → higher-dimensional data\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Uses shape, ndim, size to understand structure\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy keeps metadata about the array:\n",
        "\n",
        "shape → dimensions (rows, columns, depth…)\n",

        "⭐ Role of a Pivot Table in Pandas\n",
        "1. Summarizes Large Datasets\n",
        "\n",
        "A pivot table groups data based on one or more keys and computes summary statistics like:\n",

        "#21 Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing\n",
        "Answer - NumPy’s array slicing is much faster than Python’s list slicing because of the way NumPy stores and processes data in memory. The speed advantage comes from contiguous memory storage, vectorization, and views instead of copies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s the clear explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "⭐ Why NumPy Array Slicing Is Faster Than Python List Slicing\n",
        "1. NumPy uses contiguous memory blocks\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays store data in one continuous block of memory (similar to C arrays).\n",
        "This allows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster access\n",
        "\n",
        "Better CPU cache utilization\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient low-level operations\n",
        "\n",
        "Python lists store elements scattered across memory, pointing to objects; this slows down slicing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Slicing in NumPy creates a view, not a copy\n",
        "\n",
        "When you slice a NumPy array:\n",
        "\n",
        "arr[1:5]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy does not copy data—it creates a view that references the same memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes slicing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fast\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory-efficient\n",
        "\n",
        "Python lists always create a new list when sliced, which takes time and memory:\n",
        "\n",
        "lst[1:5]  # new list created → slow\n",
        "\n",
        "3. NumPy is written in optimized C code\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy operations (including slicing) are executed using:\n",
        "\n",
        "C loops\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-level memory pointers\n",
        "\n",
        "Highly optimized routines\n",
        "\n",
        "This avoids the overhead of Python-level loops and object handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. NumPy’s fixed data types allow faster computation\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type.\n",
        "This uniformity:\n",
